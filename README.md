# Fake Review Detection Model

## Introduction

Online platforms are increasingly plagued by fake reviews, which can mislead consumers and damage the reputation of businesses. This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to accurately identify fake product reviews.

## Overview

The Fake Review Detection Model utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to distinguish between genuine and fake reviews. The model is trained on a dataset of online product reviews and evaluates its performance based on various metrics.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Includes text normalization, tokenization, and removal of stop words and punctuation.
- Feature extraction: Utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
- Model training: Implements Logistic Regression for classification of reviews into genuine and fake categories.
- Performance evaluation: Assesses the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of online product reviews collected from various sources. Due to privacy and copyright concerns, the dataset is not provided in this repository. Users are encouraged to use similar datasets for experimentation.

## Getting Started

To run the Fake Review Detection Model on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-review-detection.git
cd fake-review-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the main script:

```bash
python fake_review_detection.py
```

## Results

Upon running the model, you will obtain performance metrics including:

- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified reviews.
- Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## Visualizations

The repository includes visualizations such as:

- Class distribution: Distribution of genuine and fake reviews in the dataset.
- Text length distribution: Histogram showing the distribution of text lengths in reviews.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Visualization of hyperparameter effects on model performance.

## Conclusion

The Fake Review Detection Model demonstrates the potential of machine learning in identifying fake reviews. While the current implementation achieves promising results, further research and experimentation are warranted to improve the model's robustness and generalization.
